# Tazlina Heart Project
This is a repo intended to store the code, STL files, and other assets used in the making and upgrading of my wonderful girlfriend's very nerdy gift from me that also doubles as a cool personal project.
The structure of the physical lamp is in the shape of a heart and is made out of reclaimed wood and a middle layer of epoxy resin to allow the internal LEDs to be seen.

I don't expect this repository to be found by people outside of my closer friend group and within my family circle, but if you do and you have questions or you would like more detailed instructions on how I made this project, what it looks like (since no media is uploaded as of this writing), and help making your own, please reach out to me via my personal email:
